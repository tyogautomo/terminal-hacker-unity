Link to my game: [Terminal Hacker](https://i.simmer.io/@tyogautomo/terminal-hacker)

Develop a game is quite challenging and fun at once for me, it needs a lot of creativity and a bunch of logic to make people are challenged playing our game.
This project is mainly purpose for learning C# basic scripting and logic in Unity, not the design and graphic.

## Gameplay
This game have 3 main screen to the gameplay:
1. Main Menu Screen
2. Decoder Screen
3. Finish Screen

The main idea of gameplay is ez, we just need to guess the anagram provided in the game based on the level difficulty you choose.
There are 3 level in this game:
1. The Wanderer (easy)
2. The Alchemist (medium)
3, The Black Witch (hard)

Each level has different difficult, it determined by the length of the words provided in the game.
